Hello, Website! This is I, Nathan Haferman, figuring out how to do website stuff through r studio and git hub. Thank you for your patience!


Here we have a plot. You can modify this plot in thousands of different ways but as for now, we are going to simply have this bad boy. 
```{r}

x <- 1:10
y <- 1:10
plot(x,y)

```

#Another thing you can do is make headers!!! 
##Or smaller headers
###Or smaller smaller headers
#####Or you can go very small


You can also do **Bold** words in this. But if you're not feeling bold, how about you try some *italics* .


####Link things!
You want to go to Facebook? Well how about you click this [word](http://facebook.com)
